       -  Channel **#pcpc**
- Moreover, we use issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/spagnuolocarmine.github.io/issues). Please use it for sharing ideas and issues on both theoretical and practical course part.

# Course homeworks

# Submit your course homework

## Prepare your submission 

Each solution should be a files repository (or directory) üóÑ, that contains the C sources, the report file (in both Markdown and PDF), and all images (if needed). 

The report file must include a:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£  presentation of the proposed solution;
- 2Ô∏è‚É£  detailed description of your project structure, and a summary of your code, which highlights the crucial aspect of your solution; 
- 3Ô∏è‚É£  deeply analysis of the performance of your program, described in terms of weak and strong scalability;
- 4Ô∏è‚É£  conclusion section, where is analyzed the reason for the obtained performance. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Solutions without the report file and/or cannot easily compiled and executed using only mpicc  and mpirun - will be not considered!

**Notes about the creation of a Tape-archive**

For archiving all files in the current directory:
```
tar -cvf solution.tar.gz *
```
For extracting files from a tape-archive:
```
tar -xvf solution.tar.gz
```

### Submission instructions

- Each solution should be compliant with the problem project exam. 
- You can submit a solution via mail 
  - üìß Mail address: [cspagnuolo+PCPC-2020-SUBMISSION@unisa.it](cspagnuolo+PCPC-2021-SUBMISSION@unisa.it)
  - Subject: Your Name & Surname, Project Title, Official exam date (ESSE3)
  - Body: what you want
  - üìì Attachment:
    -  a compressed directory using tape archive,
    -  a private GitHub repository (share to me ‚≠êÔ∏è preferred), 
    -  or any kind of easily accessible method.
- ‚ö† <span style="color:red"> The submission deadline is the day of the official exam on the ESSE3 platform.</span>

# Homework evaluation criteria

Homeworks are evaluated on a range of 30 total points. The final score is expressed in the following four levels:

Level | Range
------- | -------
**A** ü•á | [30-28]
**B** ü•à | [27-25]
**C** ü•â| [24-22]
**D** | [21-18]

## How to have a successful homework evaluation?

- üëç **Correctness**.  
  - Measures the student's commitment to developing a solution that is compliant with the problem requirement (obviously!). A solution that partially solves part of the problem will also be considered; if all the crucial aspects of the problems have been faced. The project will be evaluated using the docker-mpi container make sure that your program works on this docker ```docker run -it --mount src="$(pwd)",target=/home,type=bind spagnuolocarmine/docker-mpi:latest```.
  -  1Ô∏è0 points.
  

- üòé **Style**. 
  - Measures the student's commitment to developing a solution styling it and exploiting all features of MPI and C language, paying attention to use arguments of the parallel and concurrent computing fundamental part.
  - 1Ô∏è0 points. 

- üéØ **Problem evaluation and Benchmarks**. 
  - Measures the student's commitment to understanding the problem and gives the right solution; moreover, it measures the student's commitment to presents a deep analysis of the program performance.
  -  1Ô∏è0 points.


## Benchmarks TIPS 

Present your results in terms of strong and week scalability:

- **Strong Scalability**: How fast the problem size must increase to maintain a fixed efficiency when the number of
processes is increased. In practice, the total problem size stays the same as the number of processors increases.  
  - **Goal**: Minimize time to solution for a given problem.
- **Weak Scalability**: How fast the efficiency decreases when the number of processes increases, but the problem size is fixed. In practice, the problem size increases at the same rate as the number of processors, keeping the amount of work per processor equal. 
  - **Goal**: solve the larger problems.


## How benchmark your MPI program on a AWS EC2 cluster? 

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg" alt="aws" width="200" style="margin: 10px auto 20px; display: block;" />

All information about configuring a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances are available on this [repository](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/ubuntu-openmpi-openmp).

**Amazon educate program supports only several AWS services**, at this [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awseducate-starter-account-services/AWS_Educate_Starter_Accounts_and_AWS_Services.pdf) are described all limitations for educate account.

**Supported Instances<a name="instaces"></a>**

ID | EC2 Instance name
------- | -------
1Ô∏è‚É£ | t2.small
2Ô∏è‚É£ | t2.large
3Ô∏è‚É£ | t2.xlarge
4Ô∏è‚É£ | t2.2xlarge
5Ô∏è‚É£ | m4.large
6Ô∏è‚É£ | m4.xlarge

# The last "dance" of your course 

üíÉ **Homework Discussion** 

Finally, when the project is submitted by mail before the official exam date. 

You have to fix an appointment to discuss the project via email:
  - üìß mail address: [cspagnuolo+PCPC-2021-DISCUSSION@unisa.it](cspagnuolo+PCPC-2021-DISCUSSION@unisa.it)
  - Subject: Your Name & Surname, Project Title, Discussion
  - Body: a list of at least 4 possible days (with the time indication, e.g. 15:00), 
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è notice that all the days must be BEFORE the oral exam.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **What will the discussion be about?**

During the discussion, we will friendly investigate with the proposed solution, following the submitted report file and analyzing the most important part of the code. For discussion will be used the Discord [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/693092516286693387.svg?label=&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2)](https://discord.gg/BTt5fUp) platform, in PVT video call. Other instructions will be defined for each appointment.
