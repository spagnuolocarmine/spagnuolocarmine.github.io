abstract = {Agent-based simulations are becoming widespread among scientists from different areas, who use them to model increasingly complex problems. To cope with the growing computational complexity, parallel and distributed implementations have been developed for a wide range of platforms. However, it is difficult to have simulations that are portable to different platforms while still achieving high performance. We present OpenABL, a domain-specific language for portable, high-performance, parallel agent modeling. It comprises an easy-to-program language that relies on high-level abstractions for programmability and explicitly exploits agent parallelism to deliver high performance. A source-to-source compiler translates the input code to a high-level intermediate representation exposing parallelism, locality and synchronization, and, thanks to an architecture based on pluggable backends, generates target code for multi-core CPUs, GPUs, large clusters and cloud systems. OpenABL has been evaluated on six applications from various fields such as ecology, animation, and social sciences. The generated code scales to large clusters and performs similarly to hand-written target-specific code, while requiring significantly fewer lines of codes.},
