    "## Modeling epidemic diffution via Hypergraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In epidemiology science, the importance to explore innovative modeling tools for acutely analyzing epidemic diffusion is turning into\n",
    "a big challenge considering the myriad of real-world aspects to capture. Typically, equation-based models, such as SIS and SIR, are used\n",
    "to study the propagation of diseases over a population. Improved\n",
    "approaches also include human-mobility patterns as network information to describe contacts among individuals. However, there still\n",
    "is the need to incorporate in these models information about different types of contagion, geographical information, humans habits,\n",
    "and environmental properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that takes into account: 1. direct and indirect epidemic contagion pathways to explore the dynamics of the epidemic, 2. the times\n",
    "of possible contagions, and 3. human-mobility patterns. We combine these three features exploiting time-varying hypergraphs, and\n",
    "we embed this model into a design-methodology for agent-based\n",
    "models (ABMs), able to improve the correctness in the epidemic\n",
    "estimations of classical contact-network approaches. We further\n",
    "describe a diffusion algorithm suitable for our design-methodology\n",
    "and adaptable to the peculiarities of any disease spreading policies\n",
    "and/or models. Finally, we tested our methodology by developing\n",
    "an ABM, realizing the SIS epidemic compartmental model, for simulating an epidemic propagation over a population of individuals.\n",
    "We experimented the model using real user-mobility data from the\n",
    "location-based social network Foursquare, and we demonstrated the\n",
    "high-impact of temporal direct and indirect contagion pathways.\n",
