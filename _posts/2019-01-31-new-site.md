New site style and template made using Jekyll. I have changed my hosting because, for several problem using an Outlook mail account, I have missed the mail by TopHost, that gently asked me to rennovate my site hosting :-( now the price to update the site is about 40 euro, that's why it was an opportunities to learn new technologies as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The story is that if you are a developer you should use GitHub pages and Jekyll for your sites.
