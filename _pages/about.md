Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling designer from Buffalo, New York.

I'm into drawing [portraits of strangers](/procreate-paintings/) on an iPad Pro, eating popcorn and [chicken wings](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), watching dust collect on my [vinyl record collection](http://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing single-player console exclusives[^videogames].

[^videogames]: **Nintendo Account:** mmistakes, **Xbox Live**: [anotherJPEG](https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamerTag=anotherJPEG), **PlayStation Network**: [anotherjpeg](https://my.playstation.com/profile/anotherjpeg)

When I'm not drawing on my iPad or releasing open source [Jekyll themes](/work/jekyll-themes/), I work as a web designer and content administrator for a leading global provider of laboratory products. On any given day I'm designing user-interfaces, building landing pages, and massaging content in and out of a CMS with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And if that wasn't enough to keep me busy --- I'm also the father of [twin girls](/tag/twins/) and married to a [subscription box addicted vegan](https://2littlerosebuds.com "Wendy Rose").
